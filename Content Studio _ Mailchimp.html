At a basic level, soil is composed of mineral particles, organic matter, air, and water. The composition of soil can vary widely depending on factors such as climate, geology, and human activity, but all soils contain these basic components.","email_templates.placeholder_content_931d0665d10d891e310cfa8df71dc612":"One of the most important aspects of soil for plant growth is its texture. Soil texture refers to the size of mineral particles in the soil. This can range from clay (very small particles) to sand (large particles) with many variations in between. Soil texture affects water and nutrient retention and plant root growth.","email_templates.placeholder_content_9eedf7993101b91698366911d8b89a83":"In addition to texture, soil fertility is also important for plant growth. Fertility refers to the amount and availability of essential plant nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. These nutrients are often added to soil through fertilizers, compost, and other organic matter.It is important to note that too much of a good thing can be harmful to plants. Excessive nutrients can lead to nutrient imbalances and toxicity.

It's a direct and immediate way to engage with customers, and drive engagement or conversions through concise and targeted messaging.","sms_overview.zero_state_faqs.answer_two":"SMS marketing offers several advantages for businesses. Most importantly, it provides a direct and immediate way to reach your audience, as most people carry their mobile phones with them at all times. Its concise and targeted nature makes it ideal for time-sensitive promotions, reminders, or urgent updates. Text messages also have high open and read rates, which improves the odds of your content being seen. Additionally, SMS marketing is a great channel for personalization, and can be used to engage customers with exclusive offers and content. When used right, it can be a powerful tool for driving engagement, conversion, and brand loyalty.","sms_overview.zero_state_faqs.answer_three_p1":"<li>Best practices for bringing SMS marketing campaigns into your business include:<\/li><li>Get consent: Obtain permission from customers to receive SMS messages by offering opt-in opportunities through your website, social media, and email campaigns.<\/li><li>Keep it brief: Create concise and engaging SMS messages that provide value to your audience. Make use of personalization, a clear call-to-action, and a sense of urgency when appropriate.<\/li><li>Know your audience: Use SMS marketing automation to divide your subscribers into segments based on demographics, preferences, or purchase history. This allows for targeted messaging and better response rates.<\/li><li>Test and optimize: Experiment with different timing and message formats to dial in the resonance with your audience. Use analytics to track performance and make data-driven optimizations.<\/li><li>Make unsubscribing easy: Even though you have consent to send text messages, people have the right to change their minds. Include a simple unsubscribe link (or instructions) at the end of every marketing text.<\/li>","sms_overview.zero_state_faqs.answer_three_p2":"With solutions such as Mailchimp, you can optimize your SMS marketing campaigns with collected data and analytics in real-time. Mailchimp provides the automated text messages and SMS marketing tools you need to engage your audience, drive conversions, and enhance customer relationships.","sms_overview.zero_state_faqs.answer_four_p1":"There are two main types of SMS marketing: transactional and promotional. Transactional SMS informs your customers in real-time when something relevant happens, such as a shipped order or a confirmed appointment, while promotional SMS lets customers and prospects know about offers, sales, and opportunities. Both require opt-in consent\u2014though each has a different set of additional legal regulations that apply to them\u2014and both can be personalized to drive engagement, conversion, and loyalty.","sms_overview.zero_state_faqs.answer_four_p2":"While SMS marketing has some unique benefits and considerations, such as the direct nature of text messages and a greater need for concise wording, it's similar in many ways to other marketing channels like email and social media.

You can also send promotional text messages with discounts and sales, making use of SMS automation and audience segmentation to reach customers you think would be more likely to engage based on their purchasing behavior.","sms_overview.zero_state_faqs.answer_five_p3":"If you have a business that takes appointments, transactional SMS can help reduce your cancellation and no-show rates by texting appointment confirmations and reminders. And just as with e-commerce, you can reach out to customers with personalized offers, as well as suggestions to book again if it's been awhile since their last appointment.","sms_overview.zero_state_faqs.answer_five_p4":"Whatever your business, Mailchimp can help you integrate SMS into the rest of your marketing efforts with a powerful set of tools, automations, and analytics that work alongside your email and social media campaigns.","sms_overview.zero_state_faqs.answer_six":"SMS marketing can be very effective.
